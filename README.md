# Various Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms are required for being an great programmer. Besides that, it is fundamental for building efficient code. This repo contains some algorithms I implement by myself in order to improve understanding and practice data structure abstraction. 


#### Search Strategies
* depth-first-search
* breadth-first-search
* a* (using both hamming and manhattan as heuristic)
* 1d arr divide and conquer searching
* 1d arr straight forward searching
* 2d arr straight forward searching
* dijkstra

#### Sorting
* bubble
* insertion
* selection
* shell
* quick
* merge
* heap

#### Data Structure
* linked-list
* stack
* queue
* binary-search-tree
* avl-tree
* priority-queue (with linked-list)
* graph
* hashtable
