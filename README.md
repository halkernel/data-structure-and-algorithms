# Various Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms are required for being an great programmer. Besides that, it is fundamental for building efficient code. This repo contains some algorithms I implement by myself in order to improve understanding and practice data structure abstraction. 


#### Search Strategies
* depth-first-search
* breadth-first-search
* a* (using both hamming and manhattan as heuristic)

#### Sorting
* bouble
* insertion
* selection

#### Data Structure
* linked-list
* stack
* queue
* binary-search-tree
